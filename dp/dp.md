Solve dp problems with 3 approaches:

1. Tabulation (Bottom Up DP)
2. Memoization (Top Down DP)
<br>
Then try to optimize SC.
<br>

Identify 1D DP problems:
1. count total no.of ways
2. something that gives minimum/maximum o/p (or the best way to do something)
<br>

Shortcut:
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuff on that index as per the problem statement
3. If the statement says count all ways, sum up all the stuff
4. If the statement says find minimum/maximum of all ways, compare all & get minimum/maximum
